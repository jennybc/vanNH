When I worked with this data to prepare for our first 2014 home game, I noticed that the pulling cell is empty for point 2. When / if I actually process this game, address this.

Easiest: edit the Google spreadsheet.

Better practice for future: leave spreadsheet in its imperfect state and use an intermediate between the 01_rawGoogleExtract and the 03_concatGoogleExtract. Would require upgrading the concatenation script, i.e. having it look for and prefer a fixed Google extract.
