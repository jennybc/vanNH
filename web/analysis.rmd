x = the number of possessions that occur before a goal is finally scored  
y = the proportion of points scored after x possessions (relative to all points scored by a team)  
color indicates a hold vs. a break, i.e. holds and breaks must end after an odd and even number of possessions, respectively  
data = all 2014 MLU games involving Vancouver Nighthawks; excluding points that end with no goal due to end of period  

Observations:

  * pdsST and seaRM stand out as deriving more points by scoring on their first possession -- well over 55% vs. well below 45% for sfoDF and vanNH
  * sfoDF D line is much less effective on offense than other D lines, with pdsST being best, then vanNH
  * makes me want to look at this: of points with x or more possessions, what proportion have exactly x possessions? The first "1 possession hold" bars will not change, but then we'll see conversion rate for the D line on it's first possession ("2 possession break"), conversion rate for O line if it gets disc back("3 possession hold), etc. I expect those bars to steadily decrease and to show higher conversion rate for O lines vs D. But who knows?
