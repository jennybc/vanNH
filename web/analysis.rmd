x = the number of possessions that occur before a goal is finally scored  
y = the proportion of points scored after x possessions (relative to a team)  
color indicates a hold vs. a break, i.e. holds and breaks must end after an odd and even number of possessions, respectively  

Observations:

  * pdsST and seaRM stand out as converting more points on their first possession -- well over 50% vs. well below for sfoDF and vanNH
  * sfoDF D line is much less effective on offense than other D lines, with pdsST being best, then vanNH
