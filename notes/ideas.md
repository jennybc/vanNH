*notes, mostly from input by others, on stats to work up; Brian G, Jim P*

Develop a notion of "unforced turnover". Examples: drops when there was no defensive pressure, clear throwaways, travels. Possible counter-example: stall count, which might mostly be due to defensive pressure.

  * Difficulty: doesn't directly map onto the event codes MLU uses, so live capture would require use of a comment column (still not approved in the MLU spreadsheets) and/or video review.

What % of the time does O score in 1 possession (without any turnovers). Related to some figures I've made but not the same, because denominator will be points pulled vs. points scored.

 How often does a team score on the 1st possession after a Time Out is called (when they presumably put on their rested O line)?
 
... the number of throws a team tends to use to score. Speaks to type of O, effectiveness of the D.

What's the typical throw count when a turnover occurs? Does the D get a turn more often on throws 1-9, or 9-20?

Scatter-plot "goal-throwing %" vs "incompletion percentage" for each player and annotate/stratify the player as high touch, medium touch, or low touch, and see who separates himself from the rest. 

... interested in the use of the huck and whether that is being used optimally... What percentage completion rate do you need on a huck for it to be a good choice?

  * Difficulty: MLU stats only capture completed hucks.

Field location issues that are inaccessible at this point w/ MLU data: Is it better to have a 90 yard pull that is put into play right away or a 50 yarder where the D is fully set by the time the disc lands? If the disc is trapped, are you better off just immediately getting it off the line or should you try to keep it going?
